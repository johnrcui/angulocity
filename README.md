# Angulocity
####Animating [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) with the power of [VelocityJS](https://velocityjs.org) without having to deal with ngAnimation.
---
Angulocity is an effort to make better sense of doing animations with Angular. Angular animations are tightly bound to directives. Most animations are triggered only by events within directives and can be difficult to trigger with or for anything else. Angulocity enables animation on any element by giving them animation attribuites that can be triggered by a boolean expression.

## Requirements
* AngularJS 1.2+
* [Velocity](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity)
* [Velocity UI Pack](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity) (Optional)
